## Repo Layout

```
solutions/NNNN_problem_title/   ← zero-padded 4-digit number, words joined by _
    solution.py                 ← Python solution
    README.md                   ← problem + approach docs
    test_cases.txt              ← alternating input / expected-output lines
algo/                           ← algorithm utilities
ds/                             ← data structure implementations
scripts/                        ← repo tooling (test runner, readme updater)
```

## Per-Solution File Rules

**`solution.py`**
- One `Solution` class with LeetCode-compatible method signatures (Python 3.13+).
- Do not import from `algo/` or `ds/`. They are strictly meant for educational purposes and not for direct use in solutions.
- Only add comments when the logic is genuinely non-obvious. No step-by-step narration, no docstrings on self-evident methods.

**`README.md`** (per problem folder)
- Sections: problem link → brief problem statement → approach with time/space complexity.
- No boilerplate ("How to run", "Setup", "Installation").

**`test_cases.txt`**
- Each argument on a separate line. No outputs are included in this file; it is only for inputs. 
- Arrays: `[a,b,c]` (no spaces). Strings: `"value"`.

## Hard Rules — Never Do These

- **Never create files beyond `solution.py`, `README.md`, and `test_cases.txt` inside a solution folder.** No `__init__.py`, `test_solution.py`, `solution_v2.py`, `helpers.py`, `notes.md`, `CHANGES.md`, etc.
- **Never create extra markdown files anywhere** in the repo outside of per-problem `README.md` files.
- **Never modify the root `README.md` directly** — it is auto-generated by `scripts/update_readme.py`.
- **Never add a pytest/unittest harness** inside a solution folder.
- **Never create files in other languages** (Java, C++, JS) inside a solution folder unless explicitly asked.
