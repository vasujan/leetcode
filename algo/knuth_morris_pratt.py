# Knut Morris Pratt Algorithm

def kmp_search(S: str, W: str) -> list[int]:
    """
    Search for all occurrences of string W in string S using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.

    Find all occurrences of string `W` in string `S` using the KMP string matching algorithm.

    This algorithm works by preprocessing `W` to generate a table
    `T` of size `len(W) + 1`. Each element `T[i]` of the table is
    the length of the longest proper prefix of `W` that is also a
    suffix of `W` at position `i`. The table is used to efficiently
    skip over sections of `S` that cannot match `W`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    S : str
        The string to search in.
    W : str
        The string to search for.

    Returns
    -------
    list[int]
        A list of indices at which `W` is found in `S`, or an empty list if `W` is not found in `S`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> kmp_search("banana", "ana")
    [1, 3]
    >>> kmp_search("banana", "anb")
    []
    >>> kmp_search("", "ana")
    []
    >>> kmp_search("a", "ana")
    []
    >>> kmp_search("ana", "ana")
